### **Introduction to the Bash Shell**
<br></br>
A command line is a text user interface. One can use such an interface to provide instructions to a Linux Power computer. Our text user interfeace is GitBash
* Developed by [GNU](https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/GNU) project
* The default Linux shell on most Linux distributions
* Backward-compatible with the original sh UNIX shell
* The ```$``` is the command line prompt when bash is waiting for a command from the user. We typically call this the command prompt or shell prompt. If you are a root user the default prompt will be ```#```
<br></br>
### **Shell Commands**
<br></br>
There are two types of commands for bash shell
* Internal commans(builtins) = part of the shell itself
* External commands - seperate binaries stored in /sbin, /usr/sbin, /usr/bin, /bin, or /usr/local/bin directories

We need to execute commands using these three parts

1. The command
2. Options that typically start with a ```-``` or ```--```
3. Argument

The Bash shell understands the following commands:

* **Aliases** such as ```ll```
* **Keywords** such as ```if```
* **Functions**
* **Built in** such as ```pwd```
* **Files** such as ```/bin/date```
